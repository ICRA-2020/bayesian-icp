Introdction
===========

This code provides a reference implementation of method presented in the paper:

"Speeding up ICP using Stochastic Gradient Descent"
*F. Afzal Maken, F. Ramos, L. Ott*
IEEE International Conference on Robotics Automation, 2019


Requirements
============

The following libraries are needed to compile and run the code, the is
known to run on Ubuntu 16.04.

- boost
- eigen3
- pcl


Building
========

You will need CMake (at least version 3.1) to build the code.

```
cd sgd_icp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

Running
=======

Compiling the code will produce three executables:
- align_pcd
- pcl_align_pcd
- transform_cloud


align_pcd
---------

This program uses the SGD ICP implementation to estimate the transform
between two point clouds, the command line syntax is as follows:

`align_pcd <source_cloud> <target_cloud> <cofig_file>`

The configuration file, an example of which is provided in config.json,
sets the various parameters of the algorithm, including the initial
estimate of the transform.


pcl_align_pcd
-------------

This is a simple program which aligns the two provided points clouds
using PCL with parameters similar to the default values used by
align_pcd.

`pcl_align_pcd <source_cloud> <target_cloud>`


transform_cloud
---------------

This program applies a user specified transform onto a given cloud.

`transform_cloud --input <source_cloud> --output <output_cloud> --pose <6D vector>`
